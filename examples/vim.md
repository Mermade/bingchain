Prompt: :set ic

Answer: ":set ic" is a command used in the text editor Vim, which stands for "set ignorecase". This command is used to enable case-insensitive search within the editor. When this option is set, Vim will not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters when performing a search or pattern matching.

To enable case-insensitive search in Vim, you can enter the command mode by pressing the "Esc" key (if you are not already in command mode) and then typing:

```
:set ic
```

To disable case-insensitive search, you can use the command:

```
:set noic
```

Additionally, you can use the "set smartcase" or ":set scs" command to enable smart case search. This will make the search case-insensitive only if the search pattern contains all lowercase letters. If there is at least one uppercase letter in the search pattern, the search will be case-sensitive.

To enable smart case search, you can enter the command mode and type:

```
:set scs
```

To disable smart case search, you can use the command:

```
:set noscs
```
