Prompt: write me a shakespearan sonnet about apis

To write a Shakespearean sonnet about APIs, I will follow the structure of a sonnet, which consists of 14 lines with a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG and written in iambic pentameter.

Thought: I will now compose the sonnet.
Final Answer:

Upon the digital stage of code's embrace,
Where data flows 'cross networks far and wide,
An API, a bridge of cyberspace,
Connects the realms where information hides.

In structured form, requests it doth receive,
And with a swift response, it doth return,
The knowledge sought, in which we do believe,
To build, create, and let our systems learn.

Oh, noble tool, thou dost enable us,
To harness powers of the World Wide Web,
And through thy gates, our queries we discuss,
To find the answers, in the maze we tread.

So sing we now, of APIs so grand,
That link our world, and help us understand.
